Hello,
Working towards being a data analyst, watch my progress here.

My main goals are to master python, pandas, excel, R and SQL.

The current project(s) I'm working on:

Python
Warthunder Wiki Data Extraction, pulls data and outputs a spreadsheet for all planes in the game warthunder
Maverick, a program that uses these stats to play out a simple 'dogfight'

Tableau
Warthunder Dashboard, use the data to build an interactive visual for the plane statistics.
